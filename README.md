## Lab Setup

1. Setup GCP Account
The labs documented here make use of the GCP extensions available as part of the list of Apigee Extension types.
In order to configure the extensions instances, you will need a Google Cloud Service Account.
[Follow the instructions documented here to setup a free GCP account](https://cloud.google.com/free/)

2. Create Service Account
The labs use GCP service account credentials to access GCP services. Please follow the instructions in the setup folder below to create and configure your GCP service account.

3. Setup Backend Database (Optional)
In order for the Apigee Extenions labs to function, you will also need to use a backend database to route requests and fetch data.
NOTE: This step needs to only be done if you want to setup your own backend Firebase database. If you are interested only in completing the Extensions lab exercises, you can skip this step and directly use the pre-created *Extensions Backend Database* as documented in the indvidual labs.
If you want to setup your own extensions backend Firebase database to use in the labs, please make sure to follow the instructions documented in the folder:
